# covidScreeningAutomation
I got tired of filling out Covid Screening Google Forms at SHAD, so I created a program to do it for me. Then I monetized it for snacks with all the Shads. 

Example of the prgoram working: https://youtu.be/iTjjuqx7VU0

Got caught in the end and had got threatened to be kicked out of the program by program director at SHAD Memorial 2022.

This was the email with the flyer that I sent to everyone at our Shad Campus.
