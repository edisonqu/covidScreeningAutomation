# covidScreeningAutomation
I got tired of filling out Covid Screening Google Forms at SHAD, so I created a program to do it for me. Then I monetized it for snacks with all the Shads. 

Example of the prgoram working: https://youtu.be/iTjjuqx7VU0

Got caught in the end and had got threatened to be kicked out of the program by program director at SHAD Memorial 2022.
